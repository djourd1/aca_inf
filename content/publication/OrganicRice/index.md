abstract: "
The purpose of this paper is to explore key attributes of organic rice that consumers use in the process of choosing organic rice, and to segment organic rice market in Bangkok. Moreover, the study tends to identify the best clustering techniques, between latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) and traditional cluster analysis (CA), for precise segmentation. Best–worst scaling (BWS) method was applied to measure the level of relative importance of organic rice attributes. Then, LCCA and CA techniques were applied to recognize market segmentation. Finally, homogeneity and heterogeneity of the resulting clusters were determined to compare performance of the two clustering techniques. The LCCA technique was identified better than the CA in classification of consumers. According to LCCA solution, the organic rice market in Bangkok (Thailand) consisted of six distinct clusters, which can be grouped into three categories based on consumers' profile. Organic rice consumer categories were identified as 'Art of eating' and 'Superior quality seeker' clusters focusing on special features and quality of the organic rice; consumer category 'Basic concern' cluster heavily relied on organic certification logo and manufacturing information; and other consumer categories were 'Price driven', 'Eyes on price' and 'Thorough explorer' clusters.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We used discrete choice experiments to explore the potential adoption or alternative agricultural systems. We analyse the heterogeneity of farmers’ preferences and willingness to pay for different cropping system attributes using a mixed logit model, and we discuss the possible drivers and barriers to the adoption of these more sustainable options."
